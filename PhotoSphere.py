# This tool is based on NeHe Tutorial Lesson 48 pythonic version
# created by Brian Leair.
# It has been modified by Paolo Angelelli ((c) 2013)
# and released under GPL v2.0 license.
#
# Original Notes:
# -----
# This code is not an ideal example of Pythonic coding or use of OO 
# techniques. It is a simple and direct exposition of how to use the 
# Open GL API in Python via the PyOpenGL package. It also uses GLUT, 
# a high quality platform independent library. Due to using these APIs, 
# this code is more like a C program using procedural programming.
#
# To run this example you will need:
# Python     - www.python.org (v 2.3 as of 1/2004)
# PyOpenGL     - pyopengl.sourceforge.net (v 2.0.1.07 as of 1/2004)
# Numeric Python    - (v.22 of "numpy" as of 1/2004) numpy.sourceforge.net
